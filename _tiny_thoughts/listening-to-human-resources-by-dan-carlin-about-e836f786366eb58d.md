Listening to “Human Resources” by Dan Carlin, about slavery.

One is struck how much people were able to shape their opinions to their monetary incentives (eg, revolutionary France controlling Saint-Domingue, now Haiti)

It’s worth listening too because we are under informed about slavery, since it is avoided in media besides to make a current political point
