We are always like fish - the water we are in imposes optimization criteria and constraints we can't detect.

For instance, in startups, maybe one implicit criteria is getting wealth or revenue as fast as possible. This is good signal, but it may not actually be algined the goal we set for ourself (e.g., to build a particular kind of thing we wish to see in the world etc)
