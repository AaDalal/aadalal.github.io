And speed at, e.g., programming is not a sign of mastery. But I've realized that there is a lot of intrinsic value to being not just competent but fast (and maybe even trading off competence for speed) at programming, writing, math, drawing etc -- skills that underlie the bigger things we try to do.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think this is primarily because going fast is fun. And it's fun because it reduces the time from an idea to reality. Of course there are a lot more benefits: increased iteration speed (if you can build something 50% faster, you can make 2x the things), momentum*, and focus. The last one, \"focus\", merits more explanation. Up until a certain level of speed, a task requires concious mental effort to do. Once it gets fast enough, it is so fluent that it requires no thought; you can just focus on the hard stuff.\u003C/p>",[7,8,12,15,19,23,27,31,35],{"title":2,"slug":4,"date":3},{"title":9,"slug":10,"date":11},"Consistent Hashing","consistent-hashing","2023-10-26",{"title":13,"slug":14,"date":11},"Rendevous Hashing","rendevous-hashing",{"title":16,"slug":17,"date":18},"Python Coroutines!?!?","py-generator-couroutines","2023-06-11",{"title":20,"slug":21,"date":22},"Lessons from Product Managing","PMing","2023-06-01",{"title":24,"slug":25,"date":26},"Einsum","einsum","2022-03-14",{"title":28,"slug":29,"date":30},"Entropy","entropy","2021-12-28",{"title":32,"slug":33,"date":34},"Try again with sudo: _sudo","_sudo","2021-11-11",{"title":36,"slug":37,"date":34},"Roku & Competition","competition-focus"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
